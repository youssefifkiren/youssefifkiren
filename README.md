### Hi there üëã

I'm Youssef Ifkiren, a full-stack web developer who weaves magic with pixels and servers. Think of me as a digital alchemist, transforming lines of code into stunning UIs and robust backends. 
My tools of choice? React, Next.js, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Laravel ‚Äì the whole tech-y shebang.

‚ú®‚ú® What can I do for you? ‚ú®‚ú®

-  ‚ú® Craft UIs that Captivate: ‚ú® React and Next.js are my paintbrushes, creating interactive masterpieces that'll make your users swoon. Forget clunky interfaces, I'm all about smooth animations and intuitive design.
-  ‚ú® Tame the Mobile Beast: ‚ú® iOS and Android? Child's play. With React Native, I build apps that dance across screens like gazelles on espresso.
-  ‚ú® Tailwind Your Way to Beauty: ‚ú® Pre-styled winds at my fingertips? You bet! Tailwind CSS lets me whip up beautiful UIs faster than a hummingbird on a sugar rush. No more CSS spaghetti, just clean, maintainable code that sings.
-  ‚ú® Laravel: The Backend Guardian: ‚ú® Ô∏è PHP's knight in shining armor, that's me. I slay backend dragons with eloquent Eloquent queries and keep your data safe, like a vault guarded by grumpy but efficient squirrels.
#### But wait, there's more!

-  SolidJS: The new kid on the block? I'm keeping an eye on it, might just give it a spin and see if it tickles my fancy.
-  Express Delivery: Need an API that purrs like a kitten? I'm your delivery guy, bringing them straight to your doorstep, faster than a server on a deadline (and with less existential dread).
-  Pug & EJS: Templating is my middle name, and I do it with panache. Dynamic HTML that's smoother than a freshly paved highway, no weird syntax here.
-  Cringe: You can't beat me.
#### Wanna hang?
- GitHub: Don't be silly.
Come fork my repos, I promise I won't unleash the kraken (unless you deserve it).
- Twitter: [@y0ssef_tlg](http://twitter.com/y0ssef_tlg)
Where I tweet about code, Esports (I'm better than you in CSGO'ne), and the occasional existential crisis. It's a beautiful mess, trust me.
- Email: youssef@tlgesports.com (TLG Esports??? that's my son)
Use with caution, I reply like a sloth on vacation. But hey, at least I reply, right?

**P.S.** If you're reading this, you're officially my new best friend (until someone with a cooler tech stack shows up). Let's build something awesome, shall we?

#### Happy coding!
